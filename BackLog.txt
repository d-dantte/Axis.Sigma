1.	 Try to extract into a separate project the "Expression" part of sigma. This is to enable
	 a simplified and implementation-agnostic api for sigma. Basically, the expressions can be
	 implemented in whatever way is necessary, the endpoint should be an "Evaluate" function
	 (or similar) that when called will evaluate the rule - this was the original design.
	 we should have a separate project that now implements some "IRuleExpression" interface
	 that hosts the "Evaluate" function. This project is where i can implement the dynamic
	 expression builder that i currently have in the "Expression" namespace/package.
